today we learned: 

how to: 
 - create and use a repository
 - Start and manage a new branch
 - Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
 - Open and merge a pull request
 
 What is GitHub?
 
 is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. Work on projects from anywhere with anywhom.
 
 1. Create a new Repository 
 
  - usually used to organize a single project. 

  2. Create a Branch
  
  - Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. 
  
  Default --> 1 Branch --> main --> definitive branch
  new branch --> feature --> 
  
  
  To create a new branch
Go to your new repository hello-world.
Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: main.
Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.
